# Planning Poker Widget for Miro

## What's inside?

A plugin for Miro Board. It's an SPA with caching via service workers and it uses Preact. 

There are 14 faces and 6 backs.

11 cards represent numbers: 0, ½, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100

And 3 extra crads: Infinity, Coffee-break and Question cards

## Wait! What Planning poker is?

**Planning poker**, also called **Scrum poker**, is a consensus-based, gamified technique for estimating, mostly used to estimate effort or relative size of development goals in software development. In planning poker, members of the group make estimates by playing numbered cards face-down to the table, instead of speaking them aloud. 

The cards are revealed, and the estimates are then discussed. By hiding the figures in this way, the group can avoid the cognitive bias of anchoring, where the first number spoken aloud sets a precedent for subsequent estimates. _from [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker)_


## CLI Commands (based on preact-default)

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# test the production build locally
npm run serve

# run tests with jest and preact-render-spy
npm run test
```
